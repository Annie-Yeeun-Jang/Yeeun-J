      <h2> Research Experience </h2>
    <p> Bachelor’s thesis: Research of Recommendation systems using Deep Learning               <span class = right>   Mar. 2020 – Dec. 2020 </span>
      <br> Advised by Sangheum Hwang 
    
      <ul> 
        <li> Developed models recommending new songs for music playlists
    
    </li>
        <li>Compared performance of Autoencoder and Neural Collaborative Filtering(NCF) model </li>
        <li> Applied negative sampling and leave-one-out evaluation approaches of NCF to Autoencoder by partially masking losses of the unused data during training in autoencoder </li>
        <li> Experimented changes in performance caused by different number of latent factors, number of negative samples selected for training, and numerical balance of positive and negative samples of each user, using nDCG@10 and hit-ratio@10 for evaluation </li>
        <li>Implemented models using PyTorch and Keras. </li> 
      </ul> </p>
