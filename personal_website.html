        <h2> Research Experience </h2>
      Bachelor’s thesis: Research of Recommendation systems using Deep Learning                 Mar. 2020 – Dec. 2020
      <br> Advised by Sangheum Hwang
      
        <ul> 
          <li> Developed models recommending new songs for music playlists
      
      </li>
          <li>Compared performance of Autoencoder and Neural Collaborative Filtering(NCF) model </li>
          <li> Applied negative sampling and leave-one-out evaluation approaches of NCF to Autoencoder by partially masking losses of the unused data during training in autoencoder </li>
          <li> Experimented changes in performance caused by different number of latent factors, number of negative samples selected for training, and numerical balance of positive and negative samples of each user, using nDCG@10 and hit-ratio@10 for evaluation </li>
          <li>Implemented models using PyTorch and Keras. </li>
        </ul>
      Minor’s essay: A Study on Providing customized learning contents through K-Means clustering   Mar. 2020 – Jun. 2020
      <br> Advised by Sehak Chun
        <ul>
          <li> Developed the project “Customizing education contents with Clustering” to an essay         </li>
          <li>	Gave a presentation in the Spring Conference of Korea Intelligent Information System Society in 2020. </li>

        <ul>
          <li> Project in ‘Deep Learning’ course </li>
          <li> Classified plant leaf images into 33 classes using CNN network. Imported pre-trained model (ResNet50), oversampled rare class data to improve model performance </li>
          <li> Implemented models by Keras </li>
        </ul>
      Customizing education contents with Clustering Apr. 2020 – Jun. 2020
        <ul>
          <li> Clustered users of an online learning platform considering their individual personalities and provided customized learning curriculum </li>
          <li> Used log dataset of user’s consultation, learning, evaluation, extension and recess of enrollment </li>
          <li> Implemented efficiently to handle large-scale data (about 50 million in total) </li>
        </ul>
